# Bioconductor Classes and Methods Working Group

The Bio Classes and Methods Working Group tackles the following
questions and issues:

- What are [the 'official'
  classes](https://contributions.bioconductor.org/important-bioconductor-package-development-features.html#commonclass)?

- What is the procedure to establish a new 'official' class?

- To what extent should these be enforced during package review?

> In general, a package will not be accepted if it does not show
> interoperability with the current Bioconductor ecosystem.

- If not strictly enforced, should we at least require a wrapper
  function to convert to these?
